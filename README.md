Roughly 80,000 cyber attacks happen every single day and over 30 million attacks every year,Sensitive information of millions of customers is stolen every day. 

❖Cyber attackers can use an individual’s or a company’s sensitive data to steal information or gain access to their financial accounts, among other potentially damaging actions, which is why cyber security professionals are essential for keeping private data protected. 

❖Cyber attacks hit businesses and private systems every day, and the variety of attacks has increased quickly. “There are two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those who don’t yet know they have been hacked.”

In the modern-day, the chances of cyber threats have been increasing tremendously due to exponential growth in technology. Therefore, the need for passwords and encryption is also growing.  Though there are numerous ways to remember complicated passwords by using software tools, hardware-based security keys are preferred by top business leads. These security keys are costly and thus are not economically feasible for common people. So, we have designed a hardware-based digital locker that is capable of storing and typing hundreds of passwords encrypted with biometric as well as Bluetooth encryption thus making it impossible to crack just like a hardware authenticator.  The product is planned to design in a pen drive-like outlook along with application support.  It is built using an ATMEGA32U4-based controller in its prototype and is capable of handling multiple users’ laptops, and Google, Instagram, and Facebook passwords with a single click.


USABILITY AND SCALABILITY:
